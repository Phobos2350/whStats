I'm a bit later than previous months due to organising Takeshi's (abysmal) AT this year, but since we're 0 for 2 and Official Losers of ATXIV, I've now got the time! Woo.

First up I'd like to introduce you to the brand new [WH Stats version 2.0!](https://stats.limited-power.co.uk)
What's new?
- Redesigned layout
- More compact graphs
- Better performance
- Swanky new 'Top Kills' section for each period
- Full ship class breakdown chart
- Better caching and more accurate pulling of Kill data
- Improved [Entity Rankings](https://stats.limited-power.co.uk/entities)
- Super Awesome [Individual Entity Stats](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/entity/99005065)

Once again here are the links to the old Reddit threads so you can compare them if you like:
[August 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50o9w3/wh_stats_august_2016/)
[July 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4vnhpw/wh_stats_july_2016/)
[June 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4qp8sr/wh_stats_summary_june_2016/)

And here are the raw stats transcribed into a Spreadsheet for those of you that prefer that format
[September 2016 Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m2SKBf_toxmZ1UAwdKMGvpPE-XRh8LQUIeHhFRg0ac4/edit#gid=763465182)

Disclaimer time again! All kills are gathered using [zKillboard API](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/wiki) and [zKillboard RedisQ](https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ), so by that nature 100% of all kills are not guaranteed to have been recorded. Additionally there may be teething troubles with the redesigned site! (Like the timer on month stats, it doesn't work... will fix!)

Comparisons to August will be noted in brackets next to each statistic where possible.

To contact myself send Aekro a mail in-game or get in touch with [TAKSH] via our [Public Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/0xvNssbiAXAd4s20) and say hi.

#Class Summaries
## C1
C1s have been surprisingly busy this month, seeing a huge 42% increase in ISK killed as well as a 34% increase in T2 ship deaths. This can only be healthy for C1 space as a whole!
- 1145 Total Kills (+6%)
- 133 Billion ISK Killed (**+42%**)
- 324 Pod Kills (+22%)
- 374 T1 / 88 Faction / 119 T2 / 28 T3 Kills (+18% / +9% / **+34%** / -10%)
- 6 Battleship / 121 Cruiser/BC / 333 Frig/Des (+20% / -14% / +28%)
- 2 Citadel Kills (+0)
- 2 Carrier Kills (+2) and 1 Rorqual Kill (+0)
- 2 Logi Kills (-1)
- **116 Million ISK Average Kill** (+30 Mil)

##C2
C2s are king of the volume of kills this month, with nearly 29% of all W-Space kills total. They have also seen a huge 42% increase in ISK killed, 33% increased T2 kills and 34% increased Battleship usage. Frigate and Cruiser PvP is still the order of the day here.
- 5041 Total Kills (+22%)
- 640 Billion ISK Killed (**+42%**)
- 1466 Pod Kills (+22%)
- 1539 T1 / 498 Faction / 664 T2 / 184 T3 Kills (+15% / +16% / **+33%** / +21%)
- 184 BS / 776 Cruiser/BC / 1430 Frig/Des Kills (**+34%** / +8% / +21%)
- 0 Dread / 3 Carrier / 1 FAX Kill and 3 Misc. (Rorqual etc.) (-3 / +2 / +1 / +2)
- 21 Citadel Kills (+4)
- 43 Logi Kills (+11)
- **127 Million ISK Average Kill** (-4 Mil)

##C3
C3 space seems to be going steady with moderate increases in activity over the month. Interestingly a lot of Rorquals died in C3s this month... Proportionally, Battleships are used quite often in C3 space.
- 3421 Total Kills (+10%)
- 564 Billion ISK Killed (+20%)
- 938 Pod Kills (+13%)
- 983 T1 / 392 Faction / 454 T2 / 160 T3 Kills (+17% / +16% / +0.4% / +14%)
- 210 BS / 512 Cruiser/BC / 930 Frig/Des Kills (+5% /+2% / +21%)
- 15 Citadel Kills (+6)
- 19 Logi Kills show Logi isn't used much in C3 space, comparatively (+3)
- 0 Force Aux. / 2 Dread / 1 Carrier / 5 Misc/Rorqual Kills (-1 / +0 / -2 / +2)
- **165 Million ISK Average Kill** (+14 Mil)

##C4
C4 space overtook C5 space this month in total ISK killed with a 36% increase to 851 Billion ISK destroyed! Total kills and overall activity remained very similar to July however and the large increase in ISK destroyed is due to the massive spike in Capital usage with 29 total cap kills, 8 of which were Dreadnoughts (up from 0) and 14 Carriers (up by 3). Not surprisingly the average kill value shot up by 54 Million with all these factors in mind.
- 3584 Total Kills (+6%)
- 851 Billion ISK Destroyed (**+36%**)
- 921 Pod Kills (+11%)
- 922 T1 / 391 Faction / 602 T2 / 165 T3 Kills (+10% / +14% / -1% / +20%)
- 336 BS / 634 Cruiser/BC / 675 Frig/Des Kills show the highest BS usage once again (+1% / -4% / +16%)
- 16 Citadel Kills (+6)
- 49 Logi Kills show a big decrease in Logi dying in C4s (-31)
- 4 Force Aux. / 8 Dread / 14 Carrier / 3 Misc/Roqual Kills (+2 / **+8** / +3 / -1)
- **237 Million ISK Average Kill** (**+53 Mil**)

##C5
C5 space had a strong showing of activity increases this month, increasing total kills by 29%, but most interestingly having a 75% increase in T1 kills. Not sure what's going on here, as we don't count Shuttle or Rookie ships kills, so it rules that out. A 37% increase in Cruiser/BC usage and 31% increase in Frit/Des usage may suggest more T1 ships are being used. Cap kill totals increased in August with 5 more Carrier being destroyed than in July, but a decrease in FAX and Dread kills.
ISK Average decreased by the largest amount in all of W-Space this month, falling by 39 Million per kill on average.
- 3033 Total Kills (**+29%**)
- 755 Billion ISK Destroyed (+12%)
- 664 Pod Kills (+8%)
- 855 T1 / 311 Faction / 550 T2 / 152 T3 Kills (**+75%** / +19% / +22% / +9%)
- 268 BS / 517 Cruiser/BC / 683 Frig/Des Kills (+23% / **+37%** / +31%)
- 13 Citadel Kills (+1)
- 3 Force Aux. / 21 Dread / 11 Carrier / 2 Misc/Rorqual Kills (-2 / -3 / +5 / +2)
- **248 Million ISK Average Kill** (-39 Mil)

##C6
C6 space is back to the wasteland it was in June after a brief Resurgence in July, falling by 31% in terms of total kills and 23% in ISK destroyed. All metrics in all ship Tiers and Classes fell by over 1/3 with the biggest decreases in T3 kills and Frig/Des kills. 8 extra Dreads died in August but 7 fewer Carriers were destroyed, down to 0. ISK average per kill increased by 33 Million, a moderate amount.
- 512 Total Kills (**-31%**)
- 173 Billion ISK Destroyed (-23%)
- 123 Pod Kills (+8%)
- 120 T1 / 40 Faction / 113 T2 / 24 T3 Kills (**-45%** / **-35%** / **-36%** / **-59%**)
- 24 BS / 78 Cruiser/BC / 106 Frig/Des Kills (**-43%** / **-34%** / **-52%**)
- 2 Citadel Kills (-2)
- 1 Force Aux. / 12 Dreads / 0 Carrier / 0 Misc/Rorqual Kills (-1 / **+8** / -7 / -2)
- **337 Million ISK Average Kill** (+33 Mil)

##Thera
Thera had a brilliant month for activity inside the hole itself in August, seeing a 167% increase in ISK destroyed for 51 Million ISK per kill on average. More PvP in the system itself as opposed to just through its connections can only be a good thing for residents looking for a fight on their doorstep! The 1100% increase in Battleship kills from 0 to 11 is quite startling. Maybe people are being braver and trying to roll their Thera connections?
- 354 Total Kills (**+37%**)
- 36 Billion ISK Destroyed (**+167%**)
- 140 Pod Kills (+25%)
- 102 T1 / 26 Faction / 68 T2 / 12 T3 (+34% / **+85%** / +31% / **+300%**)
- 11 BS / 30 Cruiser/BC / 141 Frig/Des (**+1100%** / **+88%** / +16%)
- 216% Increase in Industrial kills to 19
- 0 Citadel Kills
- 0 Logi Kills (**-500%**)
- 0 Cap kills
- **101 Million ISK Average Kill** (**+51 Mil**)

##Shattered Holes
Shattered holes were busier than Thera this month, and showed a huge increase in ISK destroyed of 40%, a 200% increase in cap kills (2 Carriers) and a good increase of T3 kills at 127%. Maybe less dead shattered hole is a good thing!
- 385 Total Kills (+8%)
- 68 Billion ISK Destroyed (**+40%**)
- 103 Pod Kills (-4%)
- 114 T1 / 63 Faction / 56 T2 / 15 T3 Kills (+3% / **+37%** / +6% / +7%)
- 20 BS / 69 Cruiser/BC / 103 Frig/Des Kills (**+54%** / -4% / **+27%**)
- No Citadels because you can't anchor them in a Shattered!
- 2 Cap Kills, both Carriers (**+200%**)
- 1 Logi Kill (+1)
- **176 Million ISK Average Kill** (**+41 Mil**)

##Frigate-Sized Shattered Holes
Always poor performers in comparison to the rest of W-Space, Frig-Sized Shattered holes saw a 53% increase in ISK destroyed and 127% increase in T3 Destroyer usage. Great for the small skirmish between WH groups that can't escalate to ship bigger than a Frig/Des or a bubbled HIC.
- 90 Total Kills (+14%)
- 7.5 Billion ISK Destroyed (**+53%**)
- 24 Pod Kills (**+50%**)
- 8 T1 / 4 Faction / 8 T2 / 25 T3 Kills (**+64%** / **-60%** / **-43%** / **+127%**)
- Everything was Frigate/Destroyer sized again, wasn't there a guy that said he'd offer a sacrificial HIC this month?
- No Citadels because you can't anchor them in a Frig-Hole
- No Caps
- No Logi
- **83 Million ISK Average Kill** (+13 Mil)

#Normalised Stats!

*All kills are 'per-system' when we take the total kills across all systems and divide them over the total number of systems each Class encompasses. This works well for all systems except Thera, as there is only one of those so they are in effect already normalised in the above standard statistics.*
