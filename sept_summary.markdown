I'm a bit later than previous months due to organising Takeshi's (abysmal) AT this year, but since we're 0 for 2 and Official Losers of ATXIV, I've now got the time! Woo.

First up I'd like to introduce you to the brand new [WH Stats version 2.0!](https://stats.limited-power.co.uk)
What's new?
- Redesigned layout
- Better performance
- Swanky new 'Top Kills' section for each period
- Full ship class breakdown chart
- Better caching and more accurate pulling of Kill data
- Improved [Entity Rankings](https://stats.limited-power.co.uk/entities)
- Super Awesome [Individual Entity Stats](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/entity/99005065)

Once again here are the links to the old Reddit threads so you can compare them if you like:
[August 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50o9w3/wh_stats_august_2016/)
[July 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4vnhpw/wh_stats_july_2016/)
[June 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4qp8sr/wh_stats_summary_june_2016/)

And here are the raw stats transcribed into a Spreadsheet for those of you that prefer that format
[September 2016 Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m2SKBf_toxmZ1UAwdKMGvpPE-XRh8LQUIeHhFRg0ac4/edit#gid=763465182)

Disclaimer time again! All kills are gathered using [zKillboard API](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/wiki) and [zKillboard RedisQ](https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ), so by that nature 100% of all kills are not guaranteed to have been recorded. Additionally there may be teething troubles with the redesigned site! (Like the timer on month stats, it doesn't work... will fix!)

Comparisons to August will be noted in brackets next to each statistic where possible.

To contact myself send Aekro a mail in-game or get in touch with [TAKSH] via our [Public Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/0xvNssbiAXAd4s20) and say hi.

#Class Summaries
## C1
C1 space saw a huge increase in activity over last month, with a 78% increase in kill volume and increases across nearly all stats. There was a 133% increase in Battleship-sized kills this month as well as a 250% increase in Citadel kills.  

- 2035 Total Kills (**+78%**)
- 195 Billion ISK Killed (+46%)
- 600 Pod Kills (**+85%**)

##C2
Once again C2s rule the absolute volume statistics of kills in W-Space, accounting for nearly 27% of all WH Kills in September. C2s also see the largest volume of plain old T1 Frigate kills, accounting for
over 37% of all T1 Frigates lost in W-Space! There was nearly a doubling of Capital Kills due to 5 Dreads exploding this month.  

- 7253 Total Kills (+44%)
- 813 Billion ISK Killed (+27%)
- 2268 Pod Kills (+55%)
- 2389 T1 / 629 Faction / 914 T2 / 287 T3 Kills (+55% / +26% / +38% / +56%)
- 12 Cap Kills - 4 Industrial / 2 Carriers / 5 Dreads / 1 FAX (**+71%**)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56242038/) (5.5 B)

- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56041286/) (403 M)
- **112 Million ISK Average Kill**

##C3
C3 space saw a very good increase in activity in September; and more so than C2s, and interestingly a 60% increase in Citadel kills compare to August. A 500% increase in Carrier kills was pretty drastic as well as a much healthier use of T2 ships seeing an increase of 74%.  

- 5560 Total Kills (**+63%**)
- 768 Billion ISK Killed (+36%)
- 1482 Pod Kills (+58%)
- 1553 T1 / 560 Faction / 790 T2 / 134 T3 Kills (+58% / +43% / **+74%** / +46%)
- 15 Cap Kills - 3 Industrial / 6 Carriers / 4 Dreads / 2 FAX (**+88%**)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56315224/) (4.9 B)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55885351/) (3.5 B - Woo BPCs)
- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56072715/) (1.9 B - I Don't Even)
- **138 Million ISK Average Kill**

##C4
C4 space showed the slowest growth of all classes except Frigate-Shattered holes in September, especially when we look at just a 6% increase in total ISK value destroyed as well as a decrease of 14% in Cap Kills. In addition a decrease of 19% in Citadel kills contribute to some average statistics in September on balance.  

- 4916 Total Kills (+37%)
- 851 Billion ISK Destroyed (+6%)
- 1231 Pod Kills (+34%)
- 1240 T1 / 516 Faction / 871 T2 / 245 T3 Kills (+34% / +32% / +45% / +48%)
- 25 Cap Kills - 10 Industrial / 8 Carriers / 5 Dreads / 2 FAX (-14%)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55884609/) (6.6 B)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56293518/) (2.5 B)
- [Largest ~~NPC~~ Citadel Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55965128/) (3.7 B - My code thinks a Citadel Missile in an NPC woops, still impressive!)
- **184 Million ISK Average Kill**

##C5
C5 space saw a resurgence once again in September, though the numbers mainly lie in a huge increase in Capital kills of 102% as well as a 62% increase in all Cruiser and Battlecruiser usage. Perhaps we're seeing a return of some groups to C5 space? I know there were a fair few evictions, so they might account for a sizeable chunk of the activity on the whole. Comparing C4 and C5 space you would be forgiven for mistaking the two in September, so similar are the raw numbers!  
C5s were the only class to break 1 Trillion ISK killed in September.  

- 4414 Total Kills (+45%)
- 1.1 Trillion ISK Destroyed (+48%)
- 963 Pod Kills (+45%)
- 1175 T1 / 507 Faction / 858 T2 / 195 T3 Kills (+37% / **+63%** / +56% / +28%)
- 75 Cap Kills - 7 Industrial / 16 Carriers / **43** Dreads / 9 FAX (**+103%**)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55906728/) (9.9 B - BPOs!)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56331802/) (2.7 B - HG Snakes)
- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56156178/) (5 B - Ouch)
- **249 Million ISK Average Kill**

##C6
C6 space saw the second highest growth in September with a 130% increase in kills and 77% increase in ISK. A 191% increase in structure kills suggest a lot of this was structure bashing however which diminishes the spectacle somewhat. All the same, most metrics increased across the board and there are a lot of 100+% increases in certain statistics.

- 1176 Total Kills (**+130%**)
- 308 Billion ISK Destroyed (**+77%**)
- 273 Pod Kills (**+122%**)
- 315 T1 / 75 Faction / 226 T2 / 51 T3 Kills (**+163%** / **+88%** / **+100%** / **+113%**)
- 35 Cap Kills - 0 Industrial / 10 Carriers / 19 Dreads / 6 FAX (**+169%**)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56065435/) (6.4 B)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56331831/) (558 M)
- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56150359/) (4.3 B)
- **262 Million ISK Average Kill**

##Thera
Thera saw the largest increase in pure number of kills at +173%, but was also the only class that saw a reduction in total ISK of 7%. Most of the increased kills came from a 215% increase in Pod kills and healthy 50%+ increases in T1 and Faction kills. Industrials also so a 174% increase in kills, mostly in Mining Frigates. Thera accounts for the lowest average kill-value in all of W-Space in September.

- 965 Total Kills (**173%**)
- 33 Billion ISK Destroyed (**-7%**)
- 441 Pod Kills (**+215% !!**)
- 156 T1 / 40 Faction / 75 T2 / 11 T3 (+53% / +54% / +10% / **-8%**)
- [Largest Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56040671/) (1.9 B - Wat?)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55869041/) (574 M)
- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56193791/) (48 M)
- **34 Million ISK Average Kill**

##Shattered Holes
A healthy increase in Shattered activity for September of 67% in kill volume and 34% in total ISK destroyed. Not too bad! Less caps, more Battleships and a 114% increase in Destroyer/Frig sized kills.

- 641 Total Kills (**+66%**)
- 91 Billion ISK Destroyed (+34%)
- 182 Pod Kills (**+77%**)
- 181 T1 / 83 Faction / 108 T2 / 45 T3 Kills (+59% / +32% / **+93%** / **+200% !**)
- 1 Cap Kill, a Rorqual (-50%)
- [Largest Kill + Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56138122/) (4 B - Wat?)
- [Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56100499/) (467 M)
- **142 Million ISK Average Kill**

##Frigate-Sized Shattered Holes
Frigate-Sized holes showed the smallest growth in total kills at only +18%, most of which were T2 kills showing a 225% increase over August. No HICs again this month, and the most popular ship types overall were T3 Destroyers.  

- 106 Total Kills (+18%)
- 8.5 Billion ISK Destroyed (+14%)
- 30 Pod Kills (+25%)
- 18 T1 / 6 Faction / 26 T2 / 16 T3 Kills (+0% / -50% / **+225%** / -36%)
- [Largest Kill + Largest Solo Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56122368/) (473 M)
- [Largest NPC Loss](https://zkillboard.com/kill/56056143/) (471 M)
- **80 Million ISK Average Kill**

#Normalised Stats!

*All kills are 'per-system' when we take the total kills across all systems and divide them over the total number of systems each Class encompasses. This works well for all systems except Thera, as there is only one of those so they are in effect already normalised in the above standard statistics.*
