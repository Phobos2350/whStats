Following on from [last month's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4qp8sr/wh_stats_summary_june_2016/), it's just about time for a look at the stats for W-Space in July!

First up the links to the data so you can judge for yourselves:  
[WH Stats Hourly Kills](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/)  
[July 2016](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/july)  
[June 2016](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/june)  
[WH Entities](http://stats.limited-power.co.uk/top/eu)  

As a disclaimer once again, all kills are gathered using [zKillboard API](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/wiki) and [zKillboard RedisQ](https://github.com/zKillboard/RedisQ), so by that nature 100% of all kills are not guaranteed to have been recorded. Additionally there seems to have been an error in determining 'fleet kills' for July so we cannot compare these with the previous month.

One last thing before we begin, v2.0 of WH Stats has been in the works for the last 4 weeks and will be rolled out very soon. Check the homepage for details under the 'updates' section. To contact myself or get in touch with [TAKSH], please feel free to drop by our [Public Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/0xvNssbiAXAd4s20) and say hi.

Comparisons to June will be noted in brackets next to each statistic where possible.

*Expected error rate ~10%*

#Grand Totals
**Period 2016-07-01-0000 to 2016-07-31-2359**

#Class Summaries
## C1
Statistically just as quiet as last month over all stats, and still the 2nd quietest 'standard' part of WH Space aside from Shattered/Frig holes.

- 1083 Total Kills (-28%)
- 93 Billion ISK Killed (-20%)
- 266 Pod Kills (-46%)
- 318 T1 / 81 Faction / 89 T2 / 31 T3 Kills (-23% / -37% / -36% / -30%)
- 5 Battleship / 260 Frig/Des / 141 Cruiser/BC (-59% / -42% / -26%)
- 2 Citadel Kills (-3)
- 1 Rorqual Kill (What? +100%)
- **86 Million ISK Average Kill** (+8 Mil)

##C2
Again the busiest area of WSpace overall, and with some of the greatest variety. More Citadels were destroyed this month than last.

- 4120 Total Kills (-39%)
- 543 Billion ISK Killed (-27%)
- 1211 Pod Kills (-38%)
- 354 Industrial Kills puts C2s in the industriall heartland of WSpace
- Larger proportion of T2/T3/Faction hulls than C1s again
- 1341 T1 / 429 Faction / 498 T2 / 152 T3 Kills (-36% / -35% / -46% / -47%)
- 137 BS / 716 Cruiser/BC / 1179 Frig/Des Kills shows higher small ship usage (-37% / -36% / -38%)
- 3 Dread / 1 Carrier Kills / 4 Misc. (Rorqual etc.) (+2 / +0 / -2)
- 17 Citadel Kills (+4)
- 30 Logi Kills for a high Logistics presence in C2 space
- **131 Million ISK Average Kill** (+20 Mil)

##C3
Falling behind C4s as the second busiest region of WSpace for July, C3s are similar in composition of kills to C2s but a bit less busy overall.

- 3103 Total Kills (-38%)
- 471 Billion ISK Killed (-41%)
- 828 Pod Kills (-38%)
- 840 T1 / 338 Faction / 452 T2 / 140 T3 Kills (-40% / -33% / -36% / -37%)
- 200 BS / 502 Cruiser/BC / 771 Frig/Des Kills rounds out the proportions of ship size usage in C3 Space (-22% / -34% / -45%)
- 9 Citadel Kills (-13)
- 16 Logi Kills shows as lower Logistics usage in C3 space
- 1 Force Aux. / 2 Dread / 3 Carrier shows +1 / +1 / +3 Cap use in C3s
- **151 Million ISK Average Kill** (-9 Mil)

##C4
Comparable stats to C3 space show C4s as the second busiest overall region in WSpace in July, but with a greater overall value destroyed and better 'spread' of ship usage. Compared to other Classes, C4 space has remained most consistent month-to-month, aside from in T3 usage, where it has dropped by more than any other C1-6 class except C2s. Battleship usage seems to have replaced T3 usage in a lot of cases, perhaps showing more fights on 'home-ground' when considered alongside the increased cap usage in July.

- 3393 Total Kills (-23%)
- 624 Billion ISK Destroyed (-22%)
- 827 Pod Kills (-25%)
- 841 T1 / 338 Faction / 609 T2 / 137 T3 Kills (-21% / -25% / -21% / **-42%**)
- 332 BS / 662 Cruiser/BC / 582 Frig/Des Kills show the highest prevalence of BS usage (-16% / -18% / **-33%**)
- 10 Citadel Kills (-11)
- 80 Logistics Kills which accounts for 44% of total in WSpace showing more fleet fights occur in C4s than anywhere else at present
- 2 Force Aux. / 11 Carrier Kills (-1 / +5)
- **184 Million ISK Average Kill** (+1 Mil)

##C5
Quite a substantial decrease in overall C5 activity for July, with nearly half the total ISK killed compared to June. A higher percentage of T3 usage is demonstrated however, as are the usual cap kills. C5 space is quieter, but the types of fights remain the same in structure compared to June.

- 2345 Total Kills (-43%)
- 675 Billion ISK Destroyed (-45%)
- 616 Pod Kills (-40%)
- 489 T1 / 261 Faction / 448 T2 / 140 T3 Kills (-47% / -40% / -56% / -40%)
- 218 BS / 377 Cruiser/BC / 525 Frig/Des Kills (-43% / -48% / -43%)
- 12 Citadel Kills (-1)
- 48 Logistics Kills accounting for 26% of all WSpace
- 35 Cap Kills accounting for 40% of all WSpace Cap Kills (-49%)
- 5 Force Aux. / 24 Dread / 6 Carrier Kills (-11 / -14 / -6)
- **287 Million ISK Average Kill** (-6 Mil)

##C6
Surprisingly C6 Space remained the most consistent across June and July with very little variation in kills. Still the quietist standard region of WSpace excluding Thera/Shattered/Frig Holes. It even saw growth in total ISK destroyed (possibly this [Fortizar Kill](https://zkillboard.com/kill/55363525/)). Ship kills tended to go up, whilst pod kills went down, meaning a lot of pods got away from a lot of kills!

- 740 Total Kills (-5%)
- 225 Billion ISK Destroyed (+30%)
- 114 Pod Kills (-39%)
- 218 T1 / 62 Faction / 177 T2 / 59 T3 Kills (+34% / +26% / +42% / **+68%**)
- 42 BS / 119 Cruiser/BC / 223 Frig/Des Kills (-5% / +26% / +51%)
- 4 Citadel Kills up +4 from 0 in June
- 5 Logistics Kills, down from 11 in June, representing a smaller proportion of 'fleet fights' with Logi involved perhaps?
- 15 Cap kills total (+1), including 2 Rorquals
- 2 Force Aux. / 4 Dreads / 7 Carrier Kills (+0 / -5 / +4)
- **304 Million ISK Average Kill** (+82 Mil)

##Thera
Thera had a quiet month similar to the rest of WSpace and saw zero BS sized kills with the bulk of kills taken up by Frig/Destroyers and pods. Thera seems to be home to the highest weighted T1+T2 kill ratio with Frigate size ships in WSpace. Worth remembering is that most Thera-players get most of their kills using Thera as a base, rather than a playground, so bear that in mind when comparing! Please note that Rookie Ship kills are not included, which skews some of Thera's data somewhat owing to the high number of Rookie Ship kills.

- 258 Total Kills (-38%)
- 13 Billion ISK Destroyed (-55%)
- 112 Pod Kills (-35%)
- 76 T1 / 14 Faction / 52 T2 / 3 T3 (-40% / -33% / -25% / -83%)
- 0 BS / 16 Cruiser/BC / 122 Frig/Des
- 0 Citadel Kills
- 0 Logi Kills
- 0 Cap kills
- **50 Million ISK Average Kill** (-22 Mil)

##Shattered Holes
A lot less activity in Shattered Wormhole in July, and only one Cap kill, a Rorqual at some point possibly maybe... Mostly Cruiser and Frig-sized kills. A 70% reduction in Battleship kills suggest a lot less hole-rollers died this month!

- 355 Total Kills (-39%)
- 48 Billion ISK Destroyed (-48%)
- 107 Pod Kills (-34%)
- 111 T1 / 46 Faction / 53 T2 / 14 T3 Kills (-36% / -42% / -44% / -30%)
- 13 BS / 72 Cruiser/BC / 81 Frig/Des Kills (**-70%** / +4% / -52%)
- No Citadels because you can't anchor them in a Shattered!
- 1 Cap Kill, a Rorqual
- 0 Logi Kills
- **135 Million ISK Average Kill** (-18 Mil)

##Frigate-Sized Shattered Holes
Following June, Frigate-Sized holes again demonstrate their lack of appeal, accounting for just *0.4% of all WH Kills yet again.*

- 68 Total Kills (-38%)
- 4.8 Billion ISK Destroyed (-32%)
- 16 Pod Kills (-40%)
- 11 T1 / 10 Faction / 14 T2 / 11 T3 Kills (-39% / +10 / -23% / -56%)
- Everything was Frigate/Destroyer sized, no sneaky bubbled HICs this month...
- No Citadels because you can't anchor them in a Frig-Hole
- No Caps
- No Logi
- **70 Million ISK Average Kill** (+6 Mil)

That's about it for the 'standard' stats, infer from them what you will, but in general all activity has decreased in the month of July when compared to June 2016. The standard 'summer-lull' that hits EVE as people spend less time playing and more time enjoying the weather/going on holidays of course is one of the largest impacts on these stats. Most interesting to myself were those areas that saw growth: C6 space, C4 Cap usage and C2 ISK Averages, all indicators of life and health in WSpace, even if the overall activity levels are dropping perhaps owing most to the time of year.

Watch this space for a summary for August on the 1st September and we'll see how things compare once again, this time with the added benefit of being able to analyse kills and ship usage in more detail owing to the upgrades that v2.0 of WH Stats will introduce very soonâ„¢.

Watch the comments below for normalised stats after the thread is posted. Shouldn't take too long!

EDIT

#Normalised Stats!

*All kills are 'per-system' when we take the total kills across all systems and divide them over the total number of systems each Class encompasses. This works well for all systems except Thera, as there is only one of those so they are in effect already normalised in the above standard statistics.*
